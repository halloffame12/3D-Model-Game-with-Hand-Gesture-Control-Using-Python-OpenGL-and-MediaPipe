# 3D-Model-Game-with-Hand-Gesture-Control-Using-Python-OpenGL-and-MediaPipe
I developed a unique 3D game experience using Python, integrating OpenGL for 3D rendering and MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition. The project allows users to interact with a 3D model—a cube—through hand gestures, captured in real time via a webcam.
